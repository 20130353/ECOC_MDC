These repository offers some base implements of ECOC_MDC algorithm. 

## Repository contains:
- **simple_version1**    
    this folder offers the most basic ECOC algorithm implement. The ECOC_MDC algorithm is clearly shown in the folder.

- **simple_version2**     
    this folder offers the most basic ECOC algorithm implement, but the achievement of ECOC_MDC is merged in the ecoclib. you could use it as the way to use ecoc library.

- **advanced_version**     
    this folder offers abouve functions and some extra functions: painting for experimental result.

## Others
This repostory displays the whole work of ECOC_MDC algorithm i have worked for a two years, i hope to share my work by this platform. If you are interested this topic, welcome to interact me!
