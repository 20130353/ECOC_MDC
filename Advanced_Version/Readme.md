# Simplified_Version2
------

These repository offers some base implements of ECOC_MDC algorithm and some draw function, the fairly simple version is version of [Simplified_Version2](https://github.com/20130353/ECOC_MDC/tree/master/Simplified_Version2). 

## Repository contains:
> - data folder
> - draw_picture folder
> - ecoclib folder
> - save_file folder
> - Demo.m file
> - Readme.md file

    1. data folder contains:
        - result, for saving the result obtained by the algorithm
        - train_test, for storing the train and test data, Demo.m file would apply the files to start the procedure.
  
    2. draw_picture folder contains:
        - columnlegend.m
        - draw_acc_cplx.m
        - draw_acc_fscore.m
        - draw_classifier_ensemble_error_cplx.m
        - draw_cplx.m
        - draw_error_cplx_fsize_3D.m
        - draw_error_cplx_fsize_ensemble.m
        - draw_PD_matrix.m
        - draw_size_change.m
        
        The notes are listed in each file.
 
    3. ecoclib folder contains:
        - BDs folder.
        - Classifiers folder.
        - Codings.
        - Decodings.
        - Custer_Classifier_Test.m file.
        - ECOCTest.m file.
        - ECOCTrain.m file.
  
        note that:the library is provided by the others. if you want to know more about it, please look at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320705_Error-Correcting_Ouput_Codes_Library
        
    4. save_file contains:
        this part is not finised yet.
        
    5. Demo.m 
        this file offers a clear demo of ECOC-MDC, and numerous annotation are marked on it.
  
## Others
This repostory displays the whole work of ECOC_MDC algorithm i have worked for a two years, i hope to share my work by this platform. If you are interested this topic, welcome to interact me!
